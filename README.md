# Source code icon set

This is a set of icons for source code files. They're mainly focused around
Cocoa development. I've included the PSDs in case your favourite file format is
missing.

You can put the icons in `/Developer/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Resources/`
(make sure to keep the icon icons around). I couldn't get Xcode to use them for
the source list, but they look nice in the Finder.

The purple icon with green spots is for your most hated language. I chose PHP.
